Customer Segmentation Using Hierarchical Clustering

Objective:
The goal of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using hierarchical clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique. By understanding different customer segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, optimize resource allocation, and enhance customer satisfaction.

Methodology:
This project involves importing and analyzing a dataset of wholesale customer purchases. We will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and relationships within the data. Hierarchical clustering will be applied to group similar customers based on their purchase patterns. Additionally, two supervised learning models will be introduced to further analyze and validate the clustering results.
